        <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
        <p>I am a former pastry chef with a passion for all things tech.  I am currently enrolled
            in the Engineer Immersion Program at Thinkful. I got into this field because 
            I love thinking through problems and creating something and wanted something that would challenge my mind
            as much as it challenged my creativity. I am ready to be a full stack developer and look forward to working 
            on a team that challenges me and helps me become a better developer. I would love to collaborate on a project. <a href="#contact">contact me</a>
        </p>
        <p> When I am not in school or working on code I enjoy camping, hiking, and generally being outdoors.
              I love spending time with my family and friends cookout.  I love to travel and find new
              hidden gems. 
        </p>
        <p>I do a lot of volunteer work with a cause that is near and dear to my heart Domestic Violence.
            I volunteer as a victim advocate in hospitals and shelters.

        <h3>Coffee Shop Project</h3>
        <p>This project was made for a coffee shop to help enlighten their customers About
            the different types of coffee and the history of coffee. It was created using HTML, 
            Flexbox, and Css.</p>

        <h3>Javascript Project</h3>
         <p>This is a drill that I used Javascript for during one of our sessions at Thinkful.
             I implemented several concepts including (for-in, Arrays, functions, and if/else statements).
             It takes an array of names and job titles and allows you to access them and declares the heirarchy of the Hospital.
